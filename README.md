# Plant-vs-Zombie-Game
by [Sandeep](https://github.com/itissandeep98) & [Manan](https://github.com/Just-a-programmer)\
Remake of a classical game, using object-oriented paradigm and JavaFx as a tool\
The implementation is as follow:-
* We created different controller classes for all the fxml files, for more independent approach.
* A timeline for animation created in each instance of sprites(Character) for better multithreading.
* Multiple user by using wrapper class over the game class.
* Dynamically allocating controller for more dynamic program.
* One Parent class for all the characters and zombies, plants and lawn mover inheriting them for more generic programming.
* Storing the essential information when serialising the class, so that it consumes less space and works faster.
* We Strictly adhered to the OOP Concepts taught.
* We used data encapsulation, data abstraction and inheritance, polymorphism and many Design patterns.
* In Design Pattern, we used factory with to create instance of character, state instance for changing behaviour.
* Template design patterns for particular order of algorithm.
* Multithreading by using different timeline for different animations.
* Exception Handling for more flawless design.
* Decorator with Character class to add functionality to the Timeline and image view.\

## Bonus Components:
* We tried to implement as much as we can other than the basic requirement.
*  Almanac: A guide for the user about all the plants and zombies, their abilities and a funny little description.
*  Sound: Playing the original music from the nostalgic game to give a similar feel about the game.
*  Overview: Giving a overview about what the game is about.
*  Help: A help from our dear zombies
*  Support for multiple users: Create many ids on the game and play. All ids are mutually exclusive from each other, and work independently.
*  An enhanced and simple UI for the user
*  An easy to use Drag and Drop utility.
